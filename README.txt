This is SchivaTO project for Electronic Systems Engineering course, made by Petrolo Vincenzo and Paolino Alfredo.


In 'Schematic and PCB Layout' folder you will find:
- All our custom padstacks and footprints (PadstackLibrary and FootprintLibrary folders)
- Design schematic (SchivaTO.opj)
- PCB layout (allegro/SCHIVATO.brd)
CC2640 design schematic has been imported from the Internet in the interest of time. However, we want to clarify this is the only imported component. We still went through the whole design process for its padstacks and footprint.

In 'Technical Report' folder you will find the complete technical report about "schivaTO".

In 'Gerbers' folder you will find the Gerbers generated from our PCB, the gerbers have been validated over both Eurocircuits and PCBway.

In 'Movie' folder you will find a short video regarding our project.

The 'Gerbers.zip' file contains the compressed version of the 'Gerbers' folder that we used to upload on Eurocircuits.

The 'Eurocircuits_offer' contains the PDF file of their offer regarding our gerbers.

Thanks for your attention,
Petrolo Vincenzo and Alfredo Paolino
